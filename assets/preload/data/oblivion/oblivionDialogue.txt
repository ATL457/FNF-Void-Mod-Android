:ac1: ...It's good to be out... Finally.
:ac1: I was getting reeeaally tired of that stupid smug persona...
:ac1: So is this what you wanted? A real challenge?
:bf3: ...Boop?
:ac2: Idiot. You really have no idea what you're up against. You're looking at the REAL A.C. Void.
:ac1: This isn't about wealth, or fame... My influence has reached a critical mass.
:ac1: It won't be long before I've got every soul in the universe at my fingertips...
:ac1: ...That includes you, punk. AND your girl. If you knew your place, you'd sit back and be a spectator.
:ac2: A NOBODY...
:ac1: I was hoping you'd learn this. But if you really won't go without a fight, fine by me.
:ac2: Been a while since I've torn something apart...
:bf4: Doo BEEP!
:ac1: Pshh. Your stupidity is exhausting. You really think you can hold your ground, then?
:ac1: You're not gonna be standing after this without clawing your way out with everything you've got...
:ac2: Feeling strong?
:ac2: Come face...
:ac3: THE ALL-CONSUMING VOID!!!
