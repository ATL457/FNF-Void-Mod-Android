:v4: Oh you gotta be freakin' kidding me...
:bf2: Behh pah.
:v5: You little punk. Why the hell did you think I'd let you could come back here?
:v1: I mean... If you just HAD to get an autograph, then I guess I could understand. You're not unlike the others after all.
:v2: Shame it took you so long to come around, heh. So is that it?
:bf1: Bo, bee pah
:v3: ...A rematch?
:v3: .....
:v5: I challenged you, you SOMEHOW managed to rival my skills, and now YOU have the audacity to ask ME for a REMATCH??
:v4: You won, man. Barely. But you WON. And I was gonna let that be the end of it.
:v5: Hell, I would've been glad to never see your stupid face again. But you just had to come back to rub it in, didn't you?
:v6: You really think this is funny? You think I'm a joke??
:v7: ...You just stepped too close to a black hole, buddy. And I'm not letting you get away this time.

:v7: Alright, look. I didn't want to do this. It's been getting harder and harder to keep this form stable nowadays...
:v7: But if this is what it takes to teach you a lesson, it's your funeral, man.
:v7: You wanna go? Sure, let's go. Until either you drop where you stand...
:v8: ...Or you force me to get SERIOUS.
