:v4: Oh you gotta be freakin' kidding me...
:bf2: Behh pah.
:v5: You little punk. Why the hell did you think I'd let you come back here?
:v1: I mean... If you just HAD to get an autograph, then I guess I could understand. Shame it took you so long to come around.
:v2: I guess you're not unlike the others after all, heh. So is that it?
:bf1: Bo, bee pah
:v3: ...A rematch?
:v3: .....
:v5: I challenged you, you SOMEHOW managed to rival my skills, and now YOU have the audacity to ask ME for a REMATCH??
:v4: You won, man. Barely. But you WON. And I was gonna let that be the end of it.
:v5: Hell, I would've been glad to never see your stupid face again. But you just had to come back to rub it in, didn't you?
:v6: You really think this is funny? You think I'm a joke??
:v6: .....
:v7: Sure. Yeah, sounds good. Y-yeah... Let's do it! You little... You p-punk...
:bf3: ...Bah doo? Beep?
:v2: WHAT? What, you changed your mind or something?? Huh?? C'mon ya wuss, don't worry about me! I'm fine, stupid! Heh...
:v2: You wanna go? Sure, let's go. Until either you drop where you stand...
:v7: ...Or you force me to get SERIOUS.
